# Timer + Zen Writing App

I cobbled together a website for writing without distractions. I know plenty such sites exist already, but still wanted to do it. The textbox does not accept backspace! No deleting, no editing!
Why?

One of the reasons why I struggle to finish writing is because I'm constantly editing what I write. I know that editing is detrimental to writing. Get some stuff out there first. Get a block of marble first, and then you can chisel away.
From my site,
This tiny web thingamajig is clean, no clutter, and lets you type without backspacing. Write first, edit later! Made a typo? That's okay, just keep moving forward. You can always fix it later. Write in a flow. Get the text out of your system and refine it later.

## Uses

Can be used for journaling. I think this is a solid use case. Use it as a means of cathartic venting, void-shouting
Can be used to write without editing. Like I said earlier, irrespective of the kind of writing, content is a prerequisite. You can edit your first paragraph a billion times and get a decent one, but now you're burnt out and there's pages to write.

## Features

A word counter (that is slightly inaccurate but good enough)
The ability to save what you've written as a text file
Clean, clutter-free. Distraction free writing

## Design

It is a minimal website that uses water.css, an open-source super-simple CSS framework! This makes the site look super clean and professional with zero effort from me.
